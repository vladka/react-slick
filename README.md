### react-slick-beyli-fork

This is fork of package (See more there) https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slick <br />
In this repo are fixed some issues.

### Different features:

- **adaptive height** computed by all slides (not only by active one)
- added props: **flexMode** _(boolean, when TRUE, slide is rendered with **display: flex** (default is **inline-block**))_
- fixed **scrolling to last slide** _(when multiple slides are shown at once)_
- fixed **missing padding in "unslick mode"** _(=when slide behaviour is disabled, because there is not enough slides)_

### Installation

**yarn**

```bash
yarn add react-slick-beyli-fork
```
